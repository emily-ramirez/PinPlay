# Pinplay 0.1.0
Pinplay is a web application designed to automatically generate playlists based on popular music in their area. Unlike Spotify's collection of top hits from a country, our product designs playlists catered from city to city so that every person and region feels at home with our music.

## Status 
Pinplay is currently in its early stages of development. 

## Built With
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

## Getting Started 
Deployment of the webapp can be done using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for connecting Django with react and then deployed normally through [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/)
