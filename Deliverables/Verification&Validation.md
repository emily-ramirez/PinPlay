## 1. Description
PinPlay is a web application that automatically generates playlists to add to a user's Spotify library. Users can supply the generator with a preferred genre, whether or not to allow explicit songs in the playlist, and a city for finding popular music by location. PinPlay is designed especially for use by businesses and workers, so they can create playlists customized to local taste that customers will enjoy.

## 2. Verification (tests)

### 2.1. Unit Test

### 2.2. Integration Test
2.2.1: Selenium CLI

2.2.2: https://github.com/emily-ramirez/PinPlay/tree/master/Testing/IntegrationTest
 
2.2.3: https://github.com/emily-ramirez/PinPlay/blob/master/Testing/IntegrationTest/integration_test.py
       - This test exercises the entire pipeline of our application as it is now: It logs the user in, selects a set of filters which modify the playlist, submits the information so that the playlist can be generated, and logs the user out.

2.2.4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAaGVVCSRH8

### 2.3. Acceptance Test
Selenium IDE was used to perform the acceptance tests. 
Acceptance test folder: https://github.com/emily-ramirez/PinPlay/tree/master/Testing/AcceptanceTests
Example test link: https://github.com/emily-ramirez/PinPlay/blob/master/Testing/AcceptanceTests/test_loginandplaylistgenerationNonexplicitDancePhx.py
Here, the feature tested is the generation of a Phoenix-local, non-explicit, dance music playlist. This test includes login and is successful on the current build.

**Questions**

Q:*How simple is it to use the website?*\
A: It is simple, simple enough not complicated.

Q:*Is there anything that is missing that is offered by similar services?*\
A: Larger database of songs. I would also like to have something that compares what's trending on Youtube vs Tik tok vs Spotify.

Q:*On a scale of 1 to 10, how satisfied were you with the playlists that were generated.*\
A: 10, The playlist I've created by hand I rarely listen to so getting an auto-generated playlist that has the latest music trends makes it easier for me.

Q:*On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of the application?*\
A: 7, Its nice when you generate the playlist filter options but the window is too small. Make it bigger. As well as the playlist itself is too small make it bigger.

### Reflections

* User 1

The website was working as intended and the user did not much find much difficulty in creating a playlist. When the playlist is being generated there should be  a loading page so that the user does not repeatedly click "Submit" which creates multiple unintended playlists. There is no learning curve, but sometimes there will be impatient users who will click the buttons repeatedly. The user was able to perform the tasks given to them without any issue and they liked how easy it was to create the actual playlist. Based on the feedback, I would say that the value proposition was a success. 

* User 2

Overall, it seems that the website worked well, with only a few minor errors that need fixing. The website's way of handling web pages needs some work since logging out can give a 404 error and the link in the header does not work, but the rest of it works correctly. There is no learning curve, other than a bit of confusion with what the city selection dropdown does. The user was able to perform tasks as expected and the actions produced the expected results, with the exception of the indie pop issue. The user liked the simplicity of using the website the most, since the process was very streamlined and simple. Based on this feedback, I would say that the value proposition was accomplished.

* User 3

The website worked as expected, the user was able to go through the steps as instructed but then when I left the user to mess with the website with the intention to see any errors or break the issues appeared. The first issue appears with logging in and logging out can break the site if done on a page that's not the homepage. Another issue of playlists being inconsistant on the number of songs it generates. The user also added additional comments such as "maybe add a loading screen when generating the playlists". As well as "Change the name of what the playlist is called after generation". Overall, the user did enjoyed the simplitiy of the site and expressed they will plan to use it if available. In this interview, I say that we accomplished the value proposition.
