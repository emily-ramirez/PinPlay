### Results

* User 1
  
* User 2
Interviewed user: Skyler Bolton

- The user was able to log into his spotify account without any issues.
- Making the playlist took less than 20 seconds, and only one playlist was created for each attempt.
- The first playlist worked well, but attempting to make a playlist with the indie pop genre resulted in an empty playlist.
- The user verified his account and confirmed that the playlist was created on said account.
- Attempting to log out on the '/filters' page gave the user a 404 error.
- Clicking on the Pinplay logo in the header sent the user to a blank index.html page.
- The user found the process of using the website very simple.
- The one thing the user said was missing was a way to deal with empty playlists other than just creating and displaying them, such as making the user choose a different option.
- The user rated playlist satisfaction at an 8: the playlists were created correctly according to the parameters, but having the empty playlist issue brought the score down.
- The user rated the layout as a 7: he had some confusion with the "choose a city" dropdown and also wishes there was a loading screen to show that the playlist was in the process of being created.

### Reflections

* User 1

* User 2

Overall, it seems that the website worked well, with only a few minor errors that need fixing. The website's way of handling web pages needs some work since logging out can give a 404 error and the link in the header does not work, but the rest of it works correctly. There is no learning curve, other than a bit of confusion with what the city selection dropdown does. The user was able to perform tasks as expected and the actions produced the expected results, with the exception of the indie pop issue. The user liked the simplicity of using the website the most, since the process was very streamlined and simple. Based on this feedback, I would say that the value proposition was accomplished.
