A: The user rated playlist satisfaction at an 8: the playlists were created correctly according to the parameters, but having the empty playlist issue brought the score down.

### Reflections

* User 1

The website was working as intended and the user did not much find much difficulty in creating a playlist. When the playlist is being generated there should be  a loading page so that the user does not repeatedly click "Submit" which creates multiple unintended playlists. There is no learning curve, but sometimes there will be impatient users who will click the buttons repeatedly. The user was able to perform the tasks given to them without any issue and they liked how easy it was to create the actual playlist. Based on the feedback, I would say that the value proposition was a success. 

* User 2

Overall, it seems that the website worked well, with only a few minor errors that need fixing. The website's way of handling web pages needs some work since logging out can give a 404 error and the link in the header does not work, but the rest of it works correctly. There is no learning curve, other than a bit of confusion with what the city selection dropdown does. The user was able to perform tasks as expected and the actions produced the expected results, with the exception of the indie pop issue. The user liked the simplicity of using the website the most, since the process was very streamlined and simple. Based on this feedback, I would say that the value proposition was accomplished.
