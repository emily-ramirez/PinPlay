D6: Implementation Part 2

1. Introduction

2. Implemented Requirements

Note: Many of our implemented requirements involved contributions from several team members. All contributors to an implemented requirement will be listed, in no particular order.

In addition, not all requirements were implemented in a single pull, and not all pulls impacted only one requirement. For clarity, only one Github link will be provided as a representative for each requirement described. This may mean a team member can be listed as both a contributor and a reviewer for a requirement. This does not mean they reviewed their own pull request. It just means they were QA for the one specific pull request shown.
