Group Members: Karina Anaya, Sophia Frohna, Samantha Milligan, Jacob Penney, Emily Ramirez Serrano, Lucina de la Rosa*

## 1. Positioning
### 1.1 Problem statement

The problem of creating playlists without the knowledge of local popular music greatly affects business owners and their customer outreach; the impact of which is a lack of appeal to the local community’s music taste and lower customer satisfaction.

### 1.2. Product Position Statement

For business owners who want to easily create a playlist, Pinplay is a web application designed to automatically generate playlists based on popular music in their area. Unlike Spotify's collection of top hits from a country, our product designs playlists catered from city to city so that every person and region feels at home with our music.

### 1.3. Value proposition and consumer segment

Value Proposition:
* Pinplay allows business owners to quickly and easily create playlists based on popular music preferences, appealing to local customer taste.

Consumer Segment:
- Any business owner or worker who utilizes music
- Customers who want to listen to playlists from a business


## 2. Stakeholders

- Developers: Karina Anaya, Lucina de la Rosa, Sophia Frohna, Samantha Milligan, Jacob Penney \
Develops the specifications and requirements for the software. Developers also test and improve the application for the clients.
- Testers/Users: Developers and Customers \
This group will test and use the application for debug, usability, and consistency. They would also provide input for improvements for the applications making it more user friendly.
- Similar Applications: Spotify, Shazam \
Other applications that are similar to our music based application will help us see the differences and see what we can improve on the platforms. 

## 3. Functional requirements (features)

1. Users can enter their location into the system.
2. Users can enable explicit filters for playlists. 
3. Users can view and follow other playlists created by other users. 
4. User can sync new playlists with current Spotify account.
5. Software will create certain playlists based on user preferences.
6. Weather for the location is entered through the system and will curate playlists.

## 4. Non-functional requirements

1. Usability: Users will be able to interact with the system easily. A user who has never seen our product before will be able to generate a playlist without needing an explanation.
2. Security: Users’ login information will be communicated securely from the application to Spotify. Users’ login information will not be shared with other applications.
3. Affordability: Users will not be expected to pay any fees or subscriptions. A user who already possesses Spotify Premium will be able to access their Spotify Premium account without additional payments to our app.
4. Reliability: The application will be consistently usable and bugs will be infrequent. Users will be able to access the application at all hours except when down for maintenance.
5. Variety: Users will benefit from variety and randomness in the generation of playlists. A user will be able to generate two unique playlists within the same genre by modifying other filters.
6. Performance: Playlists will generate quickly without straining the server or users’ computers. Users will be able to run another app concurrently without straining their CPU.


## 5. MVP
Our minimum viable product will be a web application that can generate and save a playlist based on a user’s location and input filters to a user’s Spotify library. The filters will be added one at a time as team members complete the implementation. We will validate the playlist generation features by testing the generator under different conditions and filters that we input. We will validate the save feature by logging into a Spotify account through the web app and saving a playlist to the account’s library.
