### 1. Introduction
VP: Pinplay allows business owners to quickly and easily create playlists based on popular music preferences, appealing to local customer taste. 
Our product is a web application that can generate and save a playlist. The user can log into their pre-existing Spotify account through our web app and generate a playlist customized to their liking. The playlist generated can be based on a user’s location and input filters. The playlist can then be saved to a user’s Spotify library.

### 3. Adopted Technologies

### 4. Learning/training
The team used a mix of strategies to learn the technologies we adopted for the project. One of these strategies was using Mix & Match Coursera online courses to learn skills and technologies that we could apply to making our app. Another valuable resource to us was a number of online tutorials and crash courses, especially various video series on youtube. We also made sure to use our unique backgrounds and skill sets to our advantage, applying our existing skills where best suited, and helped train each other on technologies that we had strengths in.

We chose an MIT license because we want to keep our project open source so that anybody can make any changes they want to it. We don't want to restrict people from working with the API so that it can continue to be improved.
