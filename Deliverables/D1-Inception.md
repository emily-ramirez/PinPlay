Group Members: Karina Anaya, Sophia Frohna, Samantha Milligan, Jacob Penney, Emily Ramirez Serrano, Lucina de la Rosa*

## 1. Introduction

For many business owners, selecting the right music is crucial for elevating a customer’s experience. Hit new music is essential to keep customers excited but often difficult to find. Although many digital music services have discovery features, they are often limited or do not allow users to cater to a specific demographic. PinPlay is an application designed to automatically generate playlists based on local popular music. In this way, businesses can customize playlists for their target consumers. PinPlay uses music platforms and a user’s location to collect top hits in their area. These songs are then used to generate unique playlists using Spotify’s library. Finally, the playlist is automatically saved onto the user’s Spotify account with no trouble or additional cost. Users can instantly access and enjoy new music for their businesses and bring in more customers.
