**Key Insights**
  - Needs to be easy to use with a low barrier of entry\
  - Genre filter could be helpful\
  - Zip code search would also be useful\

**Representative Quotes**
  - "I feel like for me presentation and super-low-barrier-of-entry would be the big things deciding whether I use it or not"
  - "I’d be interested in having the popular here and the made here options separate because the fun part would be going to random places and seeing what's popular around there and then separately around my area I might want to see who's producing music"
  - "For looking in my own area, I'd definitely like the ability to search by zip-code in addition to physically placing a pin because I have no clue where I am on a map"

**Hypotheses that were validated**
  - They wanted the app to be simple to use
  - They would have an interest in looking at music in different areas other than their own

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care**
